#  FIN PILOT – Your Personal Financial Independence Co-Pilot  
**FIN PILOT is an AI-powered personal financial assistant designed to revolutionize the way individuals manage money. Unlike traditional finance trackers that rely on manual entry and static dashboards, FIN PILOT offers an intelligent, conversational, and simulation-based experience — making personal finance interactive, predictive, and privacy-first.**

##  Problem Statement

Managing personal finances today is fragmented, reactive, and unintelligent.

People juggle between banks, wallets, SIPs, loans, and credit cards — yet most tools offer only static dashboards, not decisions. Existing AI chatbots lack access to structured, real-time financial data, making them incapable of answering deeply personal questions like:  
> “Can I retire at 45?”  
> “Should I invest more or prepay my loan?”  
> “Why did my net worth drop this month?”

As a result, users face decision fatigue, switching between apps to manually interpret charts. Security is also a concern: password-based systems and vague data sharing compromise privacy and control.

FIN PILOT solves this by combining Gemini-powered financial reasoning, FI Money’s real-time data APIs, and OTH (One-Time Handshake) authentication for secure, actionable, and private financial intelligence.

## OTH Authentication

FIN PILOT uses a passwordless login system called **One-Time Handshake (OTH)**:

- No passwords, only secure device-tied tokens
- Cryptographic key handshake validates access
- Tokens expire automatically (ephemeral)
- Zero PII stored on servers
- Re-authentication is frictionless and secure

This ensures privacy, speed, and control — making authentication invisible but airtight.
